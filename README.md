# codies

Yet another Codenames webapp. Featuring:

-   Custom word packs
-   Timed mode
-   Quick room joining
-   Dark/light mode
-   Responsiveness for mobile play
-   And more!

This is entirely inspired by the wonderful [codenames.plus](https://github.com/Joooop/codenames.plus),
which works very well, but hasn't been scaling too well recently. I wanted an opportunity
to learn TypeScript and React, and figured I could make something that worked just as well
with a few extra niceties (and a more stable backend).
